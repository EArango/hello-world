My first repository

My name is Erick and I enjoy trying new things no matter what they are.
I'm really into music so I learned how to play some instruments. These include violin, viola, cello, bass, guitar, and ukulele.
I enjoy 100% completeing video games becasue it gives me a bigger sense of accomplishment than just playing throught the mail game and not everything it has to offer.
